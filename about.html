                <p>There is no substitute for blood, and it cannot be manufactured in a lab. The only <br> source for patients in need of a transfusion is volunteer blood donations.</p>

                    <li >Creates Helper’s High</li>
                    <p>Selfless service to others can create “helper’s high,” a feeling of elation, exhilaration, and increased energy, followed by a time of calm and serenity. It’s a mental health benefit that many blood donors experience from knowing they’re helping to save lives. This can, in turn, contribute to better physical health and longevity.</p>

                <div class="xxx" >
                    <li >Lowers Risk of Cancer</li>
                    <p>Studies in the American Journal of Epidemiology and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggest that regular blood donation may lower the risk of cancer by releasing oxidized iron from the bloodstream. Oxidized iron, which produces harmful free radicals, can build up in the bloodstream and cause cancers, particularly those of the liver, lung, colon, and esophagus.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="xxx" >
                    <li >Lowers Risk of Heart Disease</li>
                    <p>Excessive oxidized iron in the body can also be harmful to cardiovascular health. In 1998, the American Journal of Epidemiology published research that suggested blood donation is associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and strokes, so much so that regular blood donors are 88% less likely than non-donors to have a heart attack, according to the evidence in the published study. This is backed up by similar studies in the Journal of Transfusion and the Journal of the American Medical Association, which both show there’s strong evidence that blood donation lowers iron stores in the blood and liver and reduces blood viscosity, which places less stress on the arteries and blood vessels and slows blood clotting that can cause heart attack and stroke.</p>

                <div class="xxx" >
                    <li >May Slow Down the Aging Process</li>
                    <p>I’m not going to suggest that blood donation is the fountain of youth, but the fact that it does reduce free radicals in the bloodstream can possibly play a role in delaying the aging process. A study in the Journal of Basic Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology found that donating blood decreases oxidative stress, which can lead to cell and tissue damage and, in turn, aging.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="xxx" >
                    <li >Burns Calories</li>
                    <p>While blood donation should never be used as a weight loss strategy, it has been shown that blood donors can burn up to 650 calories during the donation process. This is due to your body using extra energy to replace the amount of donated blood and synthesize new proteins, red blood cells, and other blood components. Notably, this is also why donors have to meet minimum weight (110+ pounds) and age (16+) requirements to donate blood safely.</p>

                    <p>Blood is an essential life force, constantly flowing and keeping your body working. Blood is mostly fluid but contains cells and proteins that literally make it thicker than water.

                        Blood has four parts: Red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma. Each part has specific and important tasks, from carrying oxygen to carrying out waste products.
                        
                        Your blood also acts like a kind of health barometer. Unusual blood test results may be the first sign of changes that could point to serious illness. This article focuses on how blood works and conditions that affect blood health.</p>

                <div class="xxx" >
                    <li >What are the parts of blood?</li>
                    <p>Blood has four parts. Red blood cells and plasma make up most of your blood. White blood cells and platelets, sometimes referred to as the buffy coat, account for less than 1% of your blood.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="xxx" >
                    <li >White blood cells</li>
                    <p>Your white blood cells (leukocytes) account for less than 1% of your blood and are part of your immune system. When invaders such as viruses or cancerous cells launch attacks, your white blood cells move quickly to find and destroy them. White blood cells can move from capillaries into your tissues. There are five types of white blood cells:

                        * Neutrophils kill bacteria and fungi and remove foreign debris. <br>
                        <br>
                        * Lymphocytes consist of T-cells, natural killer cells and B-cells that protect against viral infections and produce antibodies * that help you fight infection. <br>
                        * Basophils react to allergens. <br>
                        * Eosinophils find and destroy parasites and cancerous cells and assist basophils with your allergic response. <br>
                        * Monocytes find and destroy viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. They also remove damaged cells.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="xxx" >
                    <li >Plasma</li>
                    <p>Your blood cells and platelets float in your plasma. Plasma is a yellowish fluid that accounts for 55% of your blood. Plasma is your blood’s utility player, covering many bases as it works to keep your body functioning. Some tasks plasma does include:

                        * Helping to clot blood and defend against invaders. 
                        <br>
                        * Delivering hormones, nutrients and proteins to parts of your body and helping to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.
                        <br>
                        * Removing waste from cells and transporting it to your liver, lungs and kidneys for excretion.
                        <br>
                        * Maintaining your blood pressure and circulation.
                        <br>
                        * Regulating body temperature by absorbing and releasing heat.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="xxx" >
                    <li >Red blood cells</li>
                    <p>Red blood cells (erythrocytes) account for 45% of your blood. They carry oxygen throughout your body. They also help to clear waste from your body. These cells:

                        * Get their distinctive color from the protein hemoglobin. Hemoglobin helps the red blood cells deliver the oxygen other cells need to produce energy.
                        <br>
                        * Can squeeze through the tiniest sections of your circulatory system. (Your circulatory system includes the network of     capillaries, veins and arteries that blood moves through on its journey throughout your body).
                        <br>
                        * Have a short life span. Red blood cells live for about 120 days before they’re replaced with new cells.</p>
